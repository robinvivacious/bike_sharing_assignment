# Bike Sharing Assignment
> This is the assignment for creating a linear model to analyse the effect of multiple dependent variables on the independent variable and for making predictions


## General Information
- This assignment is a programming assignment wherein we have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. 
- To understand the factors on which the demand for the shared bikes depends. Specifically, company want to understand the factors affecting the demand for the shared bikes in the American market.
- What is the dataset that is being used? We have used the dataset named as day.csv

## Conclusions
- We have concluded that count of number of bookings affect mostly by temperature.
- Demands of bikes increased dractically from 2018 to 2019.
- Our trained model works well with the test data as both are having the similar R2 score.
